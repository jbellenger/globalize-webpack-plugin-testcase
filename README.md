# About
This module demonstrates a potential issue when using [globalize-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/rxaviers/globalize-webpack-plugin)  with webpack-2 and [CommonsChunkPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/commons-chunk-plugin/).

# Running
```
npm install
npm start
```
After `npm start` finishes, a page will be opened in your browser containing links for good and bad webpack builds.

Errors in the bad build can be examined by clicking on the 'bad' link and examining the javascript console.
